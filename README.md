#The puzzle
How many ways are there to arrange N non-attacking queens/rooks on an N x N chessboard?

#How it works
The getSolutions function can solve both n-queens and n-rooks by specifying in the second parameter true or false, respectively.

#n-queensrooks
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair in two days.
